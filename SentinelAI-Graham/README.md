# SentinelAI
SentinelAI is a smart home device that uses facial recognition to open your door. This project was developed for Hack the North 2018.

## Features

## React Native App Development
The [Expo](https://expo.io/learn) client app was used for development. 

To run the app locally, go into the react_app directory and run the following command:

```bash
expo start
```

This will output a QR code on the console that can be scanned using the Expo app. If you are using iOS, follow the instructions on your phone screen.
