/**
 * @module
 * This module defines the settings that need to be configured for a new
 * environment.
 * The clientId and clientSecret are provided when you create
 * a new security profile in Login with Amazon.  
 * 
 * You will also need to specify
 * the redirect url under allowed settings as the return url that LWA
 * will call back to with the authorization code.  The authresponse endpoint
 * is setup in app.js, and should not be changed.  
 * 
 * lwaRedirectHost and lwaApiHost are setup for login with Amazon, and you should
 * not need to modify those elements.
